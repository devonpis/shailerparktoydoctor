                Almost 90% of faulty electronics can be repaired and saved
                from becoming an e-waste or plastic waste in our landfill.
                The root cause can be fairly simple such as poor contacts
                or damaged electronic components.&nbsp; But the problem is
                it is too time-consuming and thus costly to get it sorted
                out and repaired properly. At Toy Doctor, we aim to save
                your cherished toy at an affordable cost to encourage
                people to try getting things repaired before disposing and

      <h3>
        Rocky Balboa Motion and Sound Figure
      </h3>
      <div class = "patient-stories"  >
        <img src="images/Rocky.png" alt="rocky" >    
      </div>
      <p>
        The condition of Rocky was not good when we received him. Both his feet were broken off from the stage. He
        didnâ€™t move and sound even with new batteries. We opened Rocky up completely
        and found that the problem was due to several broken gears, moving parts and a faulty switch.  We fixed the faulty switch, replaced and repaired
        several moving parts and gears. Another issue is the inadequate leg support in the original design. Rocky has a big heavy head and a
        heavy body truck which contains 4 motors. All these were only supported by two tiny pins inside the feet. No wonders the feets were so badly broken.
        To solve this problem, we re-attached Rocky back to his stage with larger and longer bolts. We also added a few screws for extra support of the heavy head and body. After lots of
        efforts, Rocky was finally brought back to life with its legendary sound and punching motion. We're sure he will be continued to be cherished by his owner.

      </div>
        
      <p>
        According to the owner, this giant smurf is 40 years old. The owner tried to clean him, but brown powdery
        material started to leak out after the wash. We found that the brown powdery substance was actually the old stuffing
        being decomposed and kept leaking out of the fabric. In order to rescue this smurf, we needed to thoroughly remove the old stuffing, 
        which was not as easy as it sounded as the powdery substance all got stuck into the fabric and the fur. 
        We opened up the smurf and turned it completely inside out. We did a thorough vacuuming, followed by cleaning, 
        re-stuffing with new material and re-sealing. Finally this 40 years old smurf was back to his glory and continued to be
        cherished by his family.

        This old toy train belongs to my client who would like to pass his childhood toy to his grandchildren. Somehow
        the train stopped working. My client tried to fix it but didnâ€™t succeed and asked for our help. After our
        inspection, we found that the motor was disconnected and some wires were missing. There were also heaps of hairs and (carpet) fibres
        got stuck among the gears, covered with excessive lubricating grease. First, we cleaned up all
        those wheel and gears axial. Then we re-soldered all those wires and re-connected the motor with the switch and the
        battery. Vola, the train is back to life and his old-day glory. 
        Weâ€™re sure this little train will be continued to be cherished and enjoyed by their grandchildren.

        Teddy Bear with Love

      <p>
        This teddy bear was in quite a sad condition when we received him. He head was detached from his body, 
        one of his eyes, nose and some of his fur was missing.
        My client asked me to bring this sad fellow back to life, which has a very special meaning to his wife. So we
        started with removing the old stuffing material from the bear and patching up all the little holes in the fabric
        scattering all over the head and the body. Then we re-attaching the eyes and noise with some similar one. Then
        we re-attached the head to the body. Finally we re-stuff the bear with new stuffing material and add a ribbon
        around its neck. As my client preferred to keep the original fur fabric, thereâ€™s not much we can do about the
        missing fur. But at least this little fellow looked more happy than before. Weâ€™re sure he
        will continued to be treasured by his owner and live happily ever after.
